                    <p>As much as we love to take care of our ill, disabled or elderly family members, sometimes we face challenges of our own. At times, we need a short break.It has been found out in researches and surveys that
                       family caregivers have poorer health than those that are non caregivers.</p>
					<p>It’s true, you deserve a break. You have a lot more responsibilities out there besides proving to your loved one that you care for them. Hand the care giving job to us when you take a rest to regain your
						strength. At Axzons Homecare, we offer Respite Care service which are not limited to temporary care for the elderly, ill and developmentally disabled individuals but can also be provided to parents and
						families experiencing a crisis.</p>
					<p>Respite care is also given in times of emergency or to avoid the risk of abuse and neglect when you are unable to take care of a loved one temporarily.</p>
					<p>Axzon’s Respite care is planned or emergency temporary care provided to caregivers of a child or adult.</p>
					<p>Our Respite programs provide planned short-term and time-limited breaks for families and other unpaid care givers of children with a developmental delay, children with behavioral problems, adults with an
						intellectual disability, and adults with cognitive loss in order to support and maintain the primary care giving relationship. Axzons Respite also provides a positive experience for the person receiving
						care.</p>
					<p>Even though many families take great joy in providing care to their loved ones so that they can remain at home, the physical, emotional and financial consequences for the family caregiver can be overwhelming
						without some support, such as respite. Respite provides a break for the family caregiver, which may prove beneficial to the health of the caregiver.</p>
					<p>Our Respite Care has been shown to help sustain family caregiver health and well being, avoid or delay out-of-home placements, and reduce the likelihood of abuse and neglect. Axzons’s respite care may also
						reduce the likelihood of divorce and help sustain marriages.</p>
